# Quizzical

## Project Overview

Quizzical is the capstone solo project from the React Basics module of [Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). Questions are generated randomly using the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).

I deployed the site using Netlify: [https://quizzical-bslaby.netlify.app/](https://quizzical-bslaby.netlify.app/)

## Project Requirements

* The project should contain two screens, a start screen and a quiz screen with the questions.
* The quiz should consist of 5 questions pulled from the Open Trivia Database API.
* Correct answers should be tallied after the "check answers" button is clicked.
* The app should be styled and polished.

## Stretch Goal

While working on the project, I thought that it would be a huge improvement if the user had the ability to select a specific category instead of the quiz always consisting of random questions from all possible categories.  I implemented a simple dropdown menu to set the category in state before making the call to the API.  

## Note on Styling

I really struggled with the styling on this app.  I spent a lot of time playing around with color palette generators, implementing a style, and then being unsatisfied with the results.  I didn't want to use the default styling from the screenshots of the project requirements; I wanted to put my own spin on this.  But design work is HARD!  

I eventually decided to generate a color palette based on a Green Jay.  I have a strong biology background, including ornithology, and I happen to love corvids.  Furthermore, committing to this decision provided constraints that were very helpful in forcing me to actually get the work done.  A blank slate can be very stressful, especially with no design background.  And I knew that all of the colors would look good together, because Green Jays are really pretty birds.  There's something to be said for turning to nature for inspiration!

The design certainly isn't perfect.  Like I said, I'm not a designer.  But it's personal, so I'm happy to own it.
